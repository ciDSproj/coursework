# Relevant Coursework

Below are presented several assignments I worked on while studying for obtaining the Certificate in Data Science from UW Professional & Continuing Education, 2021.
The coursework covers topics like Advanced Data Analysis, Hypothesis Testing, Linear & Logistic Regression, Time Series Analysis, Advanced Machine Learning, Ensemble Learning, Neural Networks and Deep Learning.

**1. EDA and Hypothesis Simulation for House Prices**

This project contains Exploratory Data Analysis of the house dataset which includes data cleaning, visual exploration and 
investigatating summary statistics. This allowed drawing insights regarding various factors that influence a homeâ€™s price.
It also covers Hypothesis Simulation that includes computing summary statistics and confidence intervals by classical 
bootstrap and Bayesian methods, as well as hypothesis tests to determine if the differences in pairs and if multiple 
populations are significant. For data cleaning are used NumPy and Pandas libraries from Python, and Matplotlib and Seaborn 
for data visualization.

**2. Linear Regression prediction of House Prices**

The project includes selecting the features and building the initial model. This model was further improved by applying 
feature engineering and regularization techniques, like Lasso and Ridge regression. The models were compared using evaluation
metrics. For data cleaning and preprocessing are used NumPy and Pandas, and Sklearn and Statsmodels for building the models.
