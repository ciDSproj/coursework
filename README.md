# Relevant Coursework

Below are presented several assignments I worked on while studying for obtaining the Certificate in Data Science from UW Professional & Continuing Education, 2021.
The coursework covers topics like Advanced Data Analysis, Hypothesis Testing, Linear & Logistic Regression, Time Series Analysis, Advanced Machine Learning, Ensemble Learning, Neural Networks and Deep Learning.

<br> 

**1. EDA and Hypothesis Simulation for House Prices**
<br>
This project contains Exploratory Data Analysis of the house dataset which includes data cleaning, visual exploration and 
investigatating summary statistics. This allowed drawing insights regarding various factors that influence a homeâ€™s price.
It also covers Hypothesis Simulation that includes computing summary statistics and confidence intervals by classical 
bootstrap and Bayesian methods, as well as hypothesis tests to determine if the differences in pairs and if multiple 
populations are significant. For data cleaning are used NumPy and Pandas libraries from Python, and Matplotlib and Seaborn 
for data visualization.

**2. Linear Regression prediction of House Prices**
<br>
The project includes selecting the features and building the initial model. This model was further improved by applying 
feature engineering and regularization techniques, like Lasso and Ridge regression. The models were compared using evaluation
metrics. For data cleaning and preprocessing are used NumPy and Pandas, and Sklearn and Statsmodels for building the models.

**3.Time Series Analysis**
<br>
This project covers the analysis of a time series dataset. The analysis includes checking if the time series is stationary and 
has a seasonal component. It is performed an STL decomposition of the time series into its trend, seasonal and 
residual components. The analysis includes finding the best parameters for the ARIMA model, computing and evaluating the 
forecast production for the last 12 months of the data. The project is done in Python and uses NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib 
libraries.

**4.Sentiment Analysis Classification with NLP**
<br>
In this assignment was built a sentiment analysis classifier for a series of tweets. It was performed text cleaning and 
preparation, generated word clouds for both positive and negative sentiments, and built a model that classifies the sentiment 
of a sentence. It is done in Python and uses NumPy and Pandas libraries for data manipulation, NLTK libraries for 
text analysis, and sklearn for building the model.
