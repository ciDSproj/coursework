# Relevant Coursework

Below are presented several assignments I worked on while studying for obtaining the Certificate in Data Science from UW Professional & Continuing Education, 2021.
The coursework covers topics like Advanced Data Analysis, Hypothesis Testing, Linear & Logistic Regression, Time Series Analysis, Advanced Machine Learning, Ensemble Learning, Neural Networks and Deep Learning.

<br>

**EDA and Hypothesis Simulation for House Prices**
<br>
This project contains Exploratory Data Analysis of the house dataset which includes data cleaning, visual exploration and 
investigatating summary statistics. This allowed drawing insights regarding various factors that influence a homeâ€™s price.
It also covers Hypothesis Simulation that includes computing summary statistics and confidence intervals by classical 
bootstrap and Bayesian methods, as well as hypothesis tests to determine if the differences in pairs and if multiple 
populations are significant. For data cleaning are used NumPy and Pandas libraries from Python, and Matplotlib and Seaborn 
for data visualization.

**Linear Regression prediction of House Prices**
<br>
The assignment includes selecting the features and building the initial model. This model was further improved by applying 
feature engineering and regularization techniques, like Lasso and Ridge regression. The models were compared using evaluation
metrics. For data cleaning and preprocessing are used NumPy and Pandas, and Sklearn and Statsmodels for building the models.

**Time Series Analysis**
<br>
This project covers the analysis of a time series dataset. The analysis includes checking if the time series is stationary and 
has a seasonal component. It is performed an STL decomposition of the time series into its trend, seasonal and 
residual components. The analysis includes finding the best parameters for the ARIMA model, computing and evaluating the 
forecast production for the last 12 months of the data. The project is done in Python and uses NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib 
libraries.

**Sentiment Analysis Classification with NLP**
<br>
In this assignment it was built a sentiment analysis classifier for a series of tweets. It was performed text cleaning and 
preparation, generated word clouds for both positive and negative sentiments, and built a model that classifies the sentiment 
of a sentence. It is done in Python and uses NumPy and Pandas libraries for data manipulation, NLTK libraries for 
text analysis, and sklearn for building the model.

**Ensemble Models-Random Forest Classifier**
<br>
This project covers data preprocessing and exploratory analysis for a targeted marketing campaign. For classifying the 
customers who want to get bank promotion emails and the ones who don't, it was built an ensemble model (random forest) and a 
decision tree model. The performance of both models was compared by assessing their accuracy score. 
It was used NumPy and Pandas for data preprocessing, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizations and sklearn for building and 
evaluating the models.

**Image Identification with CNN**
<br>
In this project I built a machine learning model that can identify the objects in images. It is used the CIFAR-10 dataset and the model 
has the capability to search for 10 objects. To improve the model's accuracy it was adjusted the number of layers and the activation 
function, then compared the results. NumPy and Pandas libraries were used for preparing and exploring the data, and TensorFlow and Keras 
for building the neural network model.

**Topic Identification with RNN and LTSM**
<br>
For this assignment it is used the Keras Reuters newswire topics dataset to build a model that classifies the topic of each 
article or newswire. There were built and compared three different models using RNN (Recurrent Neural Network-LTSM(Long Short-Term Memory). 
For building the RNN-LTSM models are used TensorFlow and Keras libraries.

**Final Capstone Project**
<br>
The capstone project uses a dataset for semiconductor manufacturing. The dataset is cleaned and prepared, data visually 
explored and analyzed. It is also applied feature selection to reduce dimensionality of data. Inially were built and evaluated 
three different classification models: a Decision Tree classifier, Gradient Boosting and Support Vector Classifier.
The last part of the capstone project covered building a Multi-Layer Neural Network Perceptron (MLP) model, a Deep Neural 
Network (DNN) model, and a Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)- LSTM model. Each model was evaluated by calculating the accuracy 
rate. The Python libraries used are Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, sklearn, TensorFlow and Keras.
